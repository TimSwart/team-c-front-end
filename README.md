# team-c-front-end
Front-end repo

This is a simple server that presents the folders "public" and "views" to anyone requesting. Both folders are presented at top level
so for instance, to reach views/form.html, you would go to localhost:50000/form.html. Likewise to reach public/javascripts/bootstrap.min.js
you would go to localhost:50000/javascripts/bootstrap.min.js. The reason there are two folders is for the development team to 
be able to think of the view (the html given to the user) as discrete from the supporting functionality and style (the js and css).
This is an initial style descision that the frontend team is welcome to change.
